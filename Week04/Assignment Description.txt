(Inspired by Gaddis, 2015; p.188; 13. Internet Service Provider)

An Internet service provider has three different subscription packages for its customers:

Package A: For $9.95 per month 10 hours of access are provided. Additional hours are $2.00 per hour.

Package B: For $13.95 per month 20 hours of access are provided. Additional hours are $1.00 per hour.

Package C: For $19.95 per month unlimited access is provided.

Write a program that calculates a customer's monthly bill. Ask the user to enter the letter of the package the customer has purchased, and the number of hour that were used. Then calculate and display the total charges.

Comment every line; and remember to put in names and CSIDs.
