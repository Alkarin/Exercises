(Inspired by Gaddis, 2013; p.107; 12. String Manipulator)

Write a program using the public class...main structure that asks the user to enter the name of their favorite city. Use a String variable to store the input from a Scanner. The program should display the following:

The number of characters in the city name
The name of the city in all uppercase letters
The name of the city in all lowercase letters
The first character in the name of the city
Bonus: What if the city consists of two words, like San Diego?

Each line of code should have one line of comment explaining it's function.
