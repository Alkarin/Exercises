Create a phone book using ArrayList.

Write a class called PhoneBookEntry which contains fields, getters and setters for a person's name and phone number. Then create a main method to put five people into an ArrayList using PhoneBookEntry-s, and pretty print them out on the console.

NEW: implement a toString method on PhoneBookEntry that returns a pretty string of the data in the entry.

Submit your code in one .java file and the output in one .txt file.
