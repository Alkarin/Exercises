(Inspired by Gaddis, 2015; p. 313, 6. Celsius Temperature Table)

The formula for converting a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius is

C = 5/9 (F - 32)

where F is the temperature in Fahrenheit, and C is the temperature in Celsius.

Write a method name f2c that accepts a Fahrenheit temperature as an argument. The method should return the temperature converted to Celsius. In the main method write a loop to display the conversion of Fahrenheit temperatures 0 to 100 in 10 degree increments.
